####Receptive field:
is defined as all these specific properties of a sensory stimulus that generates a very robust or a strong response from any cell that you're recording from. Example: bar of light that is at a particular orientation and at a particular location on the retina
Might cause a robust response in a visual cortex cell in the cat's brain. 
2 types:
	- center-surround receptor fields
	- oriented receptive fields
###Descriptive models (what)
 ####Center-surround receptive fields in retina 
 ####Oriented receptive fields in Primary Visual Cortex(v1) 
###Mechanistic models (how)
###Interpretative models (why) 
	Immamgine come sommatoria di ReceptiveFields ad una certa intensit√† ognuno
